SCPN Theta Pinch Core — ROADMAP
-->

# Roadmap

Planned work and implemented capability are kept strictly separate. Anything
listed under "Planned" carries no implementation, no code, and no claim in
this repository until it appears in the capability inventory with evidence.

## Implemented (repository infrastructure, not reactor capability)

- Domain manifest (`reactor-domain.json`) with validator.
- Derived Studio portfolio descriptor (`not_federated`) with drift check.
- Generated capability inventory (truthfully empty) with drift check.
- CONTROL adapter specification (contract only, no implementation).
- Local and workflow gate definitions (lint, typing, tests, coverage,
  REUSE, security audit, SBOM, documentation checks).

## Planned (no implementation exists; ordering is not a commitment)

1. **Device configuration model** — typed configuration policy for the
   theta pinch (coil and preionisation classes, field-rise envelopes,
   bias-field facets), with evidence-maturity target
   `computational_prototype`.
2. **Diagnostic and clock semantics** — declared compression and end-loss
   channels and shot-relative clock identities aligned with the SCPN Phase
   Orchestrator semantic profile.
3. **Safety-envelope declaration** — machine-readable operational envelope
   (bank, coil stress, repetition bounds) consumed by the CONTROL adapter
   contract.
4. **CONTROL adapter implementation** — device-owned adapter against the
   published specification, with replay fixtures and HIL evidence,
   targeting `control_research_ready` only after replay and HIL
   acceptance.
5. **Solver seam consumption** — versioned consumption of exact
   `SCPN-FUSION-CORE` seams for implosion and compression surfaces,
   strictly after the family migration gate proves exact replacement; no
   solver code is copied.
6. **Facility-data correlation** — preregistered acceptance contracts
   against identified facility or published experimental data, targeting
   `experiment_correlated` per capability.

## Not planned in this repository

Axial-current Z-pinches, the dense plasma focus, FRC physics, closed-field
and open-field magnetic systems, inertial and magneto-inertial systems,
generic controller mathematics, machine-protection logic, and any direct
actuation path.
