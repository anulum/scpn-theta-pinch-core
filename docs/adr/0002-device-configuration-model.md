SCPN Theta-Pinch Core — ADR 0002: device configuration model
-->

# ADR 0002 — Device configuration model and evidence-maturity semantics

**Status:** accepted (2026-08-31)

**Deciders:** project owner; SCPN Reactor Systems Research Group standard

## Context

The repository was established architecture-only (ADR 0001). The first
capability lane is the device configuration model for the single
registry configuration this repository owns (`theta_pinch`). The claim
boundary and repository-level `evidence_maturity` semantics follow the
family pilot.

## Decision

1. The package `scpn_theta_pinch_core` implements the device
   configuration model as frozen, strictly typed value objects: the
   compression coil (field, radius, length) and the plasma pressure
   declaration.
2. Claim boundary — identical to the family pilot: internal-consistency
   validation, cited textbook estimates with documented bounds,
   canonical serialisation with SHA-256 digest, and the data-only SPO
   registry pin. No claim about any real machine; every exercised
   parameter set is a synthetic test fixture.
3. Hard invariant: the declared plasma pressure must not exceed the
   magnetic pressure of the compression field,
   ``beta = p / (B^2 / 2 mu0) <= 1`` — radial pressure balance of the
   theta pinch admits no confined state above unity beta.
4. Derived quantity: the magnetic pressure ``B^2 / (2 mu0)`` (standard
   magnetostatics). Advisory finding, reported by
   `consistency_report()` and never clamped: a beta below one half —
   theta pinches characteristically operate in the high-beta regime
   (F. L. Ribe, Rev. Mod. Phys. 47 (1975) 7).
5. Repository-level `evidence_maturity` = the highest state claimed by
   any capability entry; per-capability states are the authoritative
   claim surface.
6. Everything else is unchanged: review-only/non-actionable SPO
   profile, no adapter implementation, empty solver seams,
   `not_federated` Studio state, independent machine-protection veto,
   all non-claims.

## Consequences

- The Studio descriptor's `capabilities` array carries its first item
  (schema 1.1.0 data change only).
- The reactor-domain validator gains the populated-capabilities branch
  with the ceiling rule.
- Later lanes (compression/end-loss diagnostic semantics, safety
  envelope) build on these types; maturity advances per capability only
  with the evidence the family standard requires.
